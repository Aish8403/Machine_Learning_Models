# üìå Machine Learning Models

## üìñ What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It helps in automating tasks, recognizing patterns, and improving efficiency across various domains.

## üîπ Types of Machine Learning
Machine Learning is categorized into three main types:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data and makes predictions. (e.g., Spam detection, House price prediction)
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Unsupervised Learning**: The model identifies patterns and relationships in unlabeled data. (e.g., Customer segmentation, Anomaly detection)
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties. (e.g., Game playing, Robotics)

## üîç Supervised Machine Learning Models
Supervised Learning is used when the dataset has input-output pairs (labeled data). Common algorithms include:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Regression Models** (Predicting continuous values)
- **Linear Regression**: Predicts a continuous target variable by finding the best-fit line.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Extends linear regression by considering polynomial features.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: Uses Support Vector Machines for regression problems.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Classification Models** (Predicting categorical values)
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification tasks.
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-based models that split data based on feature importance.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble of decision trees to improve accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Finds the optimal hyperplane for classification.
- **Neural Networks**: Multi-layered models used for complex patterns and deep learning.

## üîç Unsupervised Machine Learning Models
Unsupervised Learning is used when there is no labeled output. It helps in pattern discovery and clustering.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clustering Algorithms** (Grouping similar data points)
- **K-Means Clustering**: Partitions data into K clusters.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Creates a tree of clusters based on similarity.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering that finds core samples and noise.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques** (Reducing feature space)
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reduces high-dimensional data while preserving variance.
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**: Used for visualizing high-dimensional data in 2D or 3D.

## üìä Model Evaluation Metrics
After training a machine learning model, it is crucial to evaluate its performance. Common metrics include:

### **For Classification Models**:
‚úÖ **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions.
‚úÖ **Precision & Recall**: Precision measures correctness of positive predictions, while Recall measures how well the model identifies all positive cases.
‚úÖ **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.
‚úÖ **Confusion Matrix**: Displays true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
‚úÖ **ROC-AUC Score**: Measures the model‚Äôs ability to distinguish between classes.

### **For Regression Models**:
‚úÖ **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
‚úÖ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the squared differences between actual and predicted values.
‚úÖ **R-Squared (R¬≤)**: Indicates how well the independent variables explain the variance of the dependent variable.
